## Introduction to TypeScript

### What is TypeScript? 
To answer this question let's refer to [the official typescript language website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). According to the website TypeScript is described as JavaScript with syntax for types, a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. 
Meaning that it's an extension and a superset of JavaScript which is developed and maintained by Microsoft as an open-source programming language.

### Why TypeScript?  
While JavaScript is powerful, its lack of static typing can lead to unexpected behavior and makes it challenging to maintain larger projects. TypeScript addresses these issues by introducing optional static typing, enabling developers to catch errors early in the development process.

JavaScript's peculiar behaviors, such as type coercion and implicit type conversion, can sometimes lead to bugs that are difficult to detect. With TypeScript, developers can define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, making code more predictable and easier to understand.

Moreover, TypeScript supports features like interfaces, enums, classes, and modules, which are absent or less robust in plain JavaScript. These language features help developers write cleaner and more maintainable code, especially in complex applications.

One of the key benefits of TypeScript is its compatibility with existing JavaScript codebases. Since TypeScript code is transpiled into plain JavaScript, it can seamlessly integrate with JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing developers to gradually introduce TypeScript into their projects without requiring a complete rewrite.
